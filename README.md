## Introduction

This repo contains the python files for a fully-python equipped AI stocks price forecast. The algorithm utilised for such prediction is LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory - if you want to learn more, please refer to the appropriate section in my profile): a special type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can process sequential data by looping over time steps and updating their internal state.

## Use case

You can find 3 .py files: whilst two are working tests aimed at giving a broader view of the task, the main one is called LSTMbot_highAcc.py.

The results obtained can be seen either by running the script within a local machine or (for a quicker approach) they can be seen in the proper folder called "images_evResults" for different stock pairs.

Any suggestion is highly appreciated.
